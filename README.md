# Python Project for Data Science  
## Revenue Data Analysis and Dashboard Building

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end to end data science workflow using Python.  
The objective is to extract historical stock price data and company revenue data, clean and process the datasets, and visualize insights through an interactive dashboard built in Jupyter Notebook.

Tesla and GameStop are used as case studies.

## Project Objectives
- Extract historical stock price data using the yfinance API  
- Scrape quarterly revenue data from web sources  
- Clean and preprocess raw datasets  
- Combine stock price and revenue data for analysis  
- Visualize trends using Python plotting libraries  
- Build a clear and interpretable dashboard  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- yfinance  
- Requests  
- BeautifulSoup  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Project Structure
- `Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard.ipynb`  
  Main notebook containing data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Data Sources
- Yahoo Finance API accessed via yfinance for stock price data  
- HTML pages provided by IBM Skills Network for revenue data  

## Key Features
- Automated extraction of historical stock price data  
- Web scraping and HTML parsing for revenue data  
- Data cleaning including removal of symbols and handling missing values
